Description: Recently a very large collection of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets 
             has been generated and publicly released. For the collection to be 
             useful, the information must be organized in a way that supports 
             queries that are relevant to researchers. `scfind` builds an index 
             from scRNA-seq datasets which organizes the information in a suitable
             and compact manner so that the datasets can be very efficiently 
             searched for either cells or cell types in which a given list of 
             genes is expressed.
